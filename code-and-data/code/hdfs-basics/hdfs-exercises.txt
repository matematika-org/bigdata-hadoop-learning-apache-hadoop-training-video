cd ~/code-and-data/data # this should've been copied into your VM or cluster in the "installing" exercise
// get the usage of our 'hadoop fs' commands
hadoop fs -help

// make a 'input-data' directory
hadoop fs -mkdir input-data
// load 'shakespeare' dataset into hdfs:
hadoop fs -put shakespeare input-data/
// you may experience an error because the data is already in there (if so, then just leave it)
// load 'page_view' dataset into hdfs
hadoop fs -put page_view page_view input-data/
// load some 'junk' data into hdfs
hadoop fs -put ~/.bash_history delete-me-later-file
// load 'gsod' dataset into hdfs
hadoop fs -df # first, make sure you're well under 100%
hadoop fs -put gsod input-data/

// gsod is a big dataset, as it's loading, you may want to pop another window & see what's happening
hadoop fs -du # keep running this command, and you'll see what's growing
// and try this one:
hadoop fs -df # make sure you're well under 100%

// make a directory in hdfs
hadoop fs -mkdir delete-me-later-dir

// do a list on our home directory:
hadoop fs -ls # relative path (to /user/[username])
hadoop fs -ls /user/cloudera #fully qualified path (note, this will be 'ubuntu' if using the AWS Cloudera Manager created stack
hadoop fs -ls input-data
// don't make this mistake
ls -lat input-data # where is this directory?

// delete our junk out
hadoop fs -rm -r delete-me-later-file
// says it moved to trash... that's nice!
hadoop fs -rm -r delete-me-later-dir

// cat some data out
hadoop fs -cat input-data/shakespeare/poems
// we can pipe this output in linux just as we're used to piping any STDOUT data
hadoop fs -cat input-data/shakespeare/poems | less
hadoop fs -tail input-data/shakespeare/poems # there is a tail command
hadoop fs -cat input-data/shakespeare/poems | head # but no head command


// get something back out of hdfs
hadoop fs -get input-data/shakespeare/poems
// browse it & then delete local copy
head poems
tail poems
rm -rf poems
